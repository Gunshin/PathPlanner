GraphGridMapMinimalist:
decide on full implementation. currently does not inherit from IGraphStructure

JPS:
	needs changing so that the start up time is better. currently attempts to regenerate the maps on every run.

GraphHierarchical :
	does not take into account any non-traversable nodes. Will have a problem with non-static maps right now
	- generate hierarchy does not take into account graph deconstruction first

HPAStart:
	only does 1st layer
	
	
DistanceNode needs changing to NodeDistance
	
Notes

attempted to modify the jpso algorithm to allow for more efficiency

first attempt was based on storing directions/neighbours of jump points. works, but i have to check the pathcost of every node i explore

second attempt was to modify the heuristic to allow nodes/directions facing the goal to be explored first as an attempt to further reduce exploration cost. did not work as suboptimal paths can be produced.

third attempt is to only add the neighbours in the direction of travel when a jump point has been found. sounds pretty reasonable, have not finished.
