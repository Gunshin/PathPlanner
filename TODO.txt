correct node implementation

JPS:
need to improve heuristic based on direction we are expanding so that nodes expanding in the correct direction will be expanded first.

GraphGridMapMinimalist:
decide on full implementation. currently does not inherit from IGraphStructure

SORT OUT GRAPH GRID MAP VECTOR OR ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION

open list:
	minimalist_node

graphs:
	searched - GraphGridMapMinimalist
	parent - xy
	traversable - GraphGridMapMinimalist
	pathcost - float
	g - float

xy:
	x - float
	y - float

minimalist_node:
	position
	priority
