correct node implementation

JPS:
could potentially try adding the neighbours of the expanding node to the open list, and then select the neighbour which is closest to expand first 
so we expand in the correct direction without having to explore all possibilities of that node.

when expanding, move forward first then check backwards if the previous node is a jump point.
